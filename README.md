## 💡 How I Work

**My Approach:**  
Break problems into **inputs → states → decisions → outputs**. Then identify where data is missing, where humans get overloaded, and where automation helps instead of hurts.

**What I'm Best At:**  
Repetitive workflows that burn time, manual data handling, complex status tracking, and any process currently living in someone's head or a spreadsheet.

**What You Get:**  
Systems that are trackable, testable, and automatable—built by someone who understands operational constraints and real-world consequences.
