        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project group focuses on tools that reduce repetitive tasks, improve consistency, and keep digital systems organized.
          The core idea is to treat workflows like systems: define rules, implement them in automation, and remove as much manual friction as possible.
        </p>

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Examples of Tools Built</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Batch renamers for files and folders based on pattern rules.</li>
          <li>Scripts to clean and normalize CSV or text-based datasets.</li>
          <li>Automations to sort assets into structured directories by type or metadata.</li>
          <li>Task sequencers that group related actions into repeatable flows.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Representative Logic Flow</h2>
        <div class="code-block">
<pre>for file in input_folder:
    info = extract_metadata(file)
    clean_name = build_consistent_name(info)
    destination = choose_destination_folder(info)
    move_and_rename(file, destination, clean_name)</pre>

      </section>

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Significant reduction in time spent on maintenance-style tasks.</li>
          <li>Improved consistency across naming, structure, and data formats.</li>
          <li>Better reliability when revisiting old work, thanks to predictable organization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Relevance to AI Ops &amp; Automation Roles</h2>
        <p>
          These tools show comfort thinking in systems, designing rules, and implementing automations that support larger
          AI pipelines, data workflows, and technical operations.
